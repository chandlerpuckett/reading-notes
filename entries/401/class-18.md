> In order to map a many-to-many association, we use the `@ManyToMany`, `@JoinTable` and `@JoinColumn` annotations. Let's have a closer look at them.

The `@ManyToMany` annotation is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship between the entities.

**This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side**

> The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify the join/linking column with the main table
