# Diversity & Inclusion

I think that addressing, and correcting the gender gap & skewed representation is vital to building a more just & equal environment for all, not only in the tech industry, but in the wider swath of society as well. Diversity is key to success, and when you place limits on your employees & your leadership, you place limits on ideas, creativity, and vision. 
  We should all work towards building a society thats inclusive & accessible to everyone.
